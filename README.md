# notify.uno
Are you tired of waiting for your tasks to finish? Just do something more important and be notified when you need to check back on your terminal.

## Use it for free
notify.uno is currently deployed on one of my servers based on this master branch using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Simolation/notify.uno/actions). Use it right now: [notify.uno](https://notify.uno/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=readme&ref=github)

## Installing / Getting started
This service uses ```nodemon``` to start the dev server and ```pm2``` to run in production

To run an own instance of notify.uno just clone this repository and make sure you have node.js installed, then run yarn to isntall all dependencies and start the nodemon dev server

```shell
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.
